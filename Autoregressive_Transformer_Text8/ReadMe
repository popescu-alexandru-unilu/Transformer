Your decoder covers many of the core components of a GPT-style model, but there are a few enhancements you might consider for a “complete” solution. Here’s a breakdown:

---

## What Your Decoder Already Has

- **Token Embeddings & Positional Encoding:**  
  Provides the base representation for each token and adds information about token position.

- **Masked Self-Attention:**  
  Implements causal masking so that each token can only attend to previous tokens.

- **Feed-Forward Network:**  
  Processes the output of the self-attention with a non-linear transformation.

- **Layer Normalization & Residual Connections:**  
  These help stabilize training and allow deeper models.

- **Final Projection & Log Softmax:**  
  Produces probabilities over the vocabulary.

## What You Might Add/Improve for a “Complete” GPT-like Model

1. **Multi-Head Attention:**  
   - **Current:** Your decoder uses a single-head attention mechanism.  
   - **Enhancement:** GPT uses multi-head attention to capture information from multiple subspaces. This improves expressiveness.

2. **Dropout:**  
   - **Purpose:** Helps prevent overfitting and improves generalization.  
   - **Where:** Typically added after self-attention and in the feed-forward layers.

3. **Weight Tying:**  
   - **Description:** Tying the weights of the embedding layer and the output projection layer can improve performance and reduce model size.

4. **Scalability & Efficiency Considerations:**  
   - **Dynamic Positional Encodings:** For handling sequences longer than your fixed maximum.
   - **Advanced Optimizations:** GPT-like models benefit from careful initialization and optimization strategies.

5. **Additional Training Techniques:**  
   - **Learning Rate Schedulers, Gradient Clipping, etc.:** These are more about training stability rather than architecture but are critical for large-scale language models.

## TL;DR

- **Your custom decoder is a solid simplified version of a GPT-like model** — it has the essential components.
- **For production-level performance, consider adding multi-head attention, dropout, and weight tying.**
